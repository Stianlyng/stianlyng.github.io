# Welcome to my digital garden🪴
After stumbling upon [Obsidian.md](https://www.obsidian.md) a couple of years ago i fell in love with notetaking, and the benefit of processesing my thoughts and research have been huge. My Obsidian notes are half English and half Norwegian, and i'll have to keep most of them to myself  - but figured i might share some cheatsheets, cool stuff and finished writing.
**Hope you like my scribbles**
