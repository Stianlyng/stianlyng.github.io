## Welcome to my digital gardenðŸª´

After stumbeling upon [Obsidian.md](https://www.obsidian.md) a couple of years ago i fell in love with notetaking, and the benefit of processesing my thoughts and research have been huge. My Obsidian notes are half English and half Norwegian, and i'll have to keep most of them to my self. But figuret i might share some cheatsheets, and finished writing or research. 

**Hope you like my scribbles**
